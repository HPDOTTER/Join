                        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
                            of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
                            <a href="">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
                            projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                            It is important to note that <a href="">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise and
                            is not intended for extensive business usage.
                            While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent

                    <h2>How to use it</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a href="">Join</a>:</p>
                        <div class="help-step-wrapper">
                            <div class="help-step-number">1.</div>
                            <div>
                                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                                <p>When you log in to <a href="">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board
                                    represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress",
                                    “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="help-step-wrapper">
                            <div class="help-step-number">2.</div>
                            <div>
                                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                                <p>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                    section, click on "New contact",
                                    and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                                    tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="help-step-wrapper">
                            <div class="help-step-number">3.</div>
                            <div>
                                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                    individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                                    card.
                                    Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                                    assignees, etc.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="help-step-wrapper">
                            <div class="help-step-number">4.</div>

                                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                                <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                    dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="help-step-wrapper">
                            <div class="help-step-number">5.</div>
                            <div>
                                <h3>Editing and Deleting Cards</h3>
                                <p>Deleting Cards
                                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                                    when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                                    Remember that using <a href="">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from
                                    you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
